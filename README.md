The Face Recognition Based Attendance System (PresentPy) revolutionizes traditional attendance tracking by employing advanced image processing libraries, utilizing face recognition techniques to analyze student data, and offering a dynamic user interface. It collects and analyzes student data, including facial features and attendance records. Leveraging image processing libraries, the system employs face recognition to automate attendance tracking. PresentPy utilizes OpenCV for image analysis and continuously refines its accuracy based on user feedback and evolving facial recognition trends. The technology stack includes Python for algorithm implementation, OpenCV, Haarcascade classifier, and the LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram) algorithm for face recognition, NumPy for array based data management, Tkinter and Pillow for the user interface, and MySQL for database management. The integration of image processing technologies and face recognition approach enables PresentPy to provide accurate and adaptive attendance tracking, revolutionizing traditional attendance tracking methodologies.
